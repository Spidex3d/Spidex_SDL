Hi I'm The Dyslexic Programmer. I'm not really a programmer, I'm a retired horticulturist. iv only played with C++ and found it very interesting so now I have lots of time to try and learn this stuff. my aim is to go from all but zero to making a Games Engine / 3d Model Editor using Opengl. follow along and watch me make a complete fool of myself.
